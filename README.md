# Agricultural Science Spoil Multiplier

Lets you change the spoil time for agricultural science from **0.5×** (twice as fast), **1×** (default) to **10000×** instead of removing spoilage altogether.

## Important Notes

- If you use this in a save you're already running, this will only apply to **new science packs**, not the ones you already have.
- This mod only changes the **spoilage rate** (`spoil_ticks`) of agricultural science packs. It **does not affect how quickly labs consume them**.
- Existing science packs may still be consumed rapidly in labs if their **freshness is not 100%**.
- Interactions with other mods (e.g., Fridge) or any resource spoilage mods may cause packs to decay or be consumed faster than expected.
- The mod affects only **newly produced packs**; already-decayed packs will retain their current freshness.
- Use extreme multipliers with caution, as lab behavior and other mod interactions may produce unexpected results.
